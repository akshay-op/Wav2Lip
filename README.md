Prerequisites
-------------
- `Python 3.6` 
- ffmpeg: `sudo apt-get install ffmpeg`
- Install necessary packages using `pip install -r requirements.txt`. Alternatively, instructions for using a docker image is provided [here](https://gist.github.com/xenogenesi/e62d3d13dadbc164124c830e9c453668). Have a look at [this comment](https://github.com/Rudrabha/Wav2Lip/issues/131#issuecomment-725478562) and comment on [the gist](https://gist.github.com/xenogenesi/e62d3d13dadbc164124c830e9c453668) if you encounter any issues. 
- Face detection [pre-trained model](https://www.adrianbulat.com/downloads/python-fan/s3fd-619a316812.pth) should be downloaded to `face_detection/detection/sfd/s3fd.pth`. Alternative [link](https://iiitaphyd-my.sharepoint.com/:u:/g/personal/prajwal_k_research_iiit_ac_in/EZsy6qWuivtDnANIG73iHjIBjMSoojcIV0NULXV-yiuiIg?e=qTasa8) if the above does not work.

Getting the weights
----------
| Model  | Description |  Link to the model | 
| :-------------: | :---------------: | :---------------: |
| Wav2Lip  | Highly accurate lip-sync | [Link](https://iiitaphyd-my.sharepoint.com/:u:/g/personal/radrabha_m_research_iiit_ac_in/Eb3LEzbfuKlJiR600lQWRxgBIY27JZg80f7V9jtMfbNDaQ?e=TBFBVW)  |
| Wav2Lip + GAN  | Slightly inferior lip-sync, but better visual quality | [Link](https://iiitaphyd-my.sharepoint.com/:u:/g/personal/radrabha_m_research_iiit_ac_in/EdjI7bZlgApMqsVoEUUXpLsBxqXbn5z8VTmoxp55YNDcIA?e=n9ljGW) |

| Visual Quality Discriminator  | Weights of the visual disc trained in a GAN setup | [Link](https://iiitaphyd-my.sharepoint.com/:u:/g/personal/radrabha_m_research_iiit_ac_in/EQVqH88dTm1HjlK11eNba5gBbn15WMS0B0EZbDBttqrqkg?e=ic0ljo) |

Lip-syncing videos using the pre-trained models (Inference)
-------
You can lip-sync any video to any audio:
```bash
python inference.py --checkpoint_path <ckpt> --face <video.mp4> --audio <an-audio-source> 
```
The result is saved (by default) in `results/result_voice.mp4`. You can specify it as an argument,  similar to several other available options. The audio source can be any file supported by `FFMPEG` containing audio data: `*.wav`, `*.mp3` or even a video file, from which the code will automatically extract the audio.

##### Tips for better results:
- Experiment with the `--pads` argument to adjust the detected face bounding box. Often leads to improved results. You might need to increase the bottom padding to include the chin region. E.g. `--pads 0 20 0 0`.
- If you see the mouth position dislocated or some weird artifacts such as two mouths, then it can be because of over-smoothing the face detections. Use the `--nosmooth` argument and give another try. 
- Experiment with the `--resize_factor` argument, to get a lower resolution video. Why? The models are trained on faces which were at a lower resolution. You might get better, visually pleasing results for 720p videos than for 1080p videos (in many cases, the latter works well too). 
- The Wav2Lip model without GAN usually needs more experimenting with the above two to get the most ideal results, and sometimes, can give you a better result as well.
